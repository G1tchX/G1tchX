    <h1>What happened at WWDC25<em></em></h1>
    <p>Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference 2025 (WWDC25), held from June 9–13, was one of the most visually transformative and AI-centric keynotes in recent memory. The company unveiled a striking new design language called “Liquid Glass,” which introduces a sleek, fluid aesthetic across all of Apple’s major platforms—iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 “Tahoe”, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. This interface features translucent layers, depth effects, glass-like panels, and dynamic shadows that bring consistency to Apple’s ecosystem. While some users initially found the design too transparent and hard to read, Apple responded quickly with enhanced contrast modes and improved legibility in the latest beta versions.

Another major focus at WWDC25 was the expansion of Apple Intelligence, Apple’s suite of AI capabilities built with user privacy at its core. Apple introduced on-device foundation models now available to developers through the new Foundation Models API. Users benefit from practical, real-time AI tools like Live Translation in Messages, FaceTime, and Phone, all processed locally. A new feature called Visual Intelligence allows the system to analyze screenshots and on-screen content to offer context-aware actions—like identifying clothing in a photo or offering links related to text. AI-powered tools like Genmoji (custom emoji generation), Image Playground (instant image generation), and Workout Buddy (an AI fitness coach on Apple Watch) show just how deep Apple is embedding generative intelligence into everyday interactions.

iOS 26 brings powerful upgrades to core apps and usability. The Phone app now includes call screening, voicemail summaries, and Hold Assist, which can wait on hold for you. Messages introduces polls, custom chat backgrounds, typing indicators, and smart filters to help keep unknown senders out of view. Safari adopts macOS-style tab groups and interface controls, and the Camera app is redesigned for a more intuitive shooting experience. These enhancements, combined with the system-wide Liquid Glass visuals, make iOS 26 one of the most refined updates in years.

iPadOS 26 finally bridges the productivity gap between tablets and laptops. It now supports real windowed multitasking, allowing users to drag, resize, and tile app windows like on macOS. The addition of a new Preview app, background tasks, and a customizable menu bar brings a true desktop feel to the iPad. Coupled with improved pointer control and keyboard shortcuts, Apple positions the iPad as a serious alternative to the Mac for many users.

On the wrist, watchOS 26 gets a refreshed look thanks to Liquid Glass and introduces subtle but meaningful interaction upgrades. A new “wrist flick” gesture lets users dismiss notifications quickly. The Workout Buddy AI coach delivers personalized motivation and feedback during workouts. There are also improvements to the Smart Stack, a native Notes app, new watch faces, and real-time Live Translation, making the Apple Watch more independent and versatile.

tvOS 26 and visionOS 26 were also updated, albeit more quietly. tvOS gets new regional screensavers, persistent AirPlay speaker selection, and karaoke-style lyrics in Apple Music. visionOS now allows spatial widget placement, support for PlayStation VR2 controllers, and more refined scrolling using head tracking. These updates enhance usability in the living room and in spatial computing environments.

Another notable addition in macOS 26 “Tahoe” is the introduction of a Games app, centralizing Apple Arcade and native game titles in one hub. With graphics enhancements via Metal 4, better battery efficiency, and new windowing features like Exposé and Stage Manager, gaming on the Mac gets a significant push. Developers were also treated to Xcode 26, which includes an integrated code assistant powered by Apple’s own foundation models, offering real-time suggestions, error fixes, and testing automation.

Perhaps the most interesting meta-change was Apple’s move toward year-based OS naming, as seen with iOS 26 and macOS 26, replacing the previous numbered approach (e.g., iOS 17, macOS Sonoma). Public betas for all new systems are expected to launch in July 2025, with stable releases arriving in the fall alongside new hardware.

In summary, WWDC25 marked a clear pivot for Apple. While there was no new hardware, the emphasis on design, AI, and developer tools points to a bold new direction for the company. The Liquid Glass aesthetic marks the biggest visual leap since iOS 7. Meanwhile, Apple Intelligence combines local processing with practical AI use cases, placing Apple in a strong position amid growing competition. Whether you’re a casual user or a developer, Apple’s ecosystem in 2025 feels more integrated, intelligent, and personalized than ever before.</p>
