    <h1>My Take On IOS 26</h1>
    <p>Apple’s new version 26 betas are controversial. Some say the look is amazing and gives them nostalgia from the Windows Aero era, but others think it looks messy and clunky. Here’s the scoop for what’s new in Apple’s version 26 betas.

iOS 26
—————————————————<br>
All the 26 betas include the new Liquid Glass, including iOS 26. Apple also added new Apple Intelligence features like call screening, which shows you what unknown callers, who are likely scammers, say. Another new feature is Live Translation, which translates languages you don’t know, so if your grandma speaks French, but you only know English, whatever she says on a call will be translated to English in real-time.


iPadOS 26
—————————————————<br>
iPadOS 26 also includes the new Liquid Glass effect, and, ironically enough, I actually wrote this on the iPadOS 26 developer beta 3! With iPadOS 26, we get new multitasking. Apple finally added a complete windowing system, which also adds the MacOS traffic light buttons to close, minimize and maximize apps. And this new Stage Manager 2.0-kind of system is coming to all iPads, including models without M-series chipsets.


MacOS 26 “Tahoe”
—————————————————<br>
Again, MacOS Tahoe includes Liquid Glass. Apple also redesigned Spotlight, and now instead of the Launchpad, your apps are all in Spotlight. Now you can send messages, run shortcuts and more, all in Spotlight.


watchOS 26
—————————————————<br>
watchOS 26 introduces great features, like the Notes app. Another new feature is Workout Buddy, which encourages you while you run. Or swim. Or bike. Or something. watchOS 26 also introduces Wrist Flick, which is basically the opposite of Double Tap.


visionOS 26
—————————————————<br>
visionOS 26 introduces widgets, which act like real things in real life. visionOS 26 does not introduce Liquid Glass, since the whole point of Liquid Glass is to mimic visionOS.


So there you go. Detailed info about Apple’s version 26 betas. This is Anuraghav Sasidharan, and see you next time!
